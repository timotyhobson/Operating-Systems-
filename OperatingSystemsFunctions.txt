An OS is just a special program that manages the resources of a computer. Anyone can create one. A modern one will take a lot of effort to make.
An Operating system is the software that interacts with the hardware. Windows, Linux and OS X are examples of common operating systems.
The OS manages how hardware and software communicate with each other. If it didn't, every piece of software would need it's own communication protocols and would have a strict list of compatible hardware.
